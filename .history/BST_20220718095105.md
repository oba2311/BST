1. `liver-server` is really really bad when changing CSS UNLESS it is started from a directory rather than .html file.

i.e. `~/something/something/ % live-server something/`

2. In order to create a new project on git via CLI git CLI is needed -
   `gh create repo ${name}` to create the remote via CLI.
   Then add all and commit push.

3. `Emmet` on nvim is used with a key combination rather than automatically.
   i.e. `M-y then ,` in my case.

4. `.tmux.config` will not load if the symlink is broken. Symlink should be created from the destination's folder i.e. `~% ln -s something/.dotfiles/.tmux.config .`

5. When tmux dies unexpectedly often, it might help to delete the tmux folder form `/temp/` folder.

6. A WAY better way to work with the command area of nvim is through `:ctrl f` which will open a nvim-like mini window to work on with the command area.

7. in css/html when the meta attribute fails to fill the screen with content in mobile, there is an option to use `min-width: fit-content` attribute.
8. iterm2 and tmux integratio works really well, if started from iterm2.
9. oh-my-zsh is needed for zsh plugins. a super important plugin is `autosuggestions`.
10. Always remember to add `__dirname` to the relative path for `res.sendFile` in express.

11. When working with `flex` and `CSS` always make sure there are no trailing `<br>`s that mess up the spacing.
12. ALWAYS check for html native tags before some other fancy stuff - e.g. `<input type='date'>` instead of a package.
13. Better to work with `CDN` rather than `npm` for better preformance (caching).
14. Put the JS `script`s at the bottom of the HTML to make sure UI loads before the packages.
15. `Promises` work differently and cannot be accessed synchoronisly. `then` has to be used, for example when calling a fetch API.
16. TBD Grid VS Flex.

17. in iterm2 when `option` key is defined as `meta` then `prefix C-b` which is in many cases a defualt would work out of the box.
18. `cd` in `FZF` would work only as part of `FZF` in shell (or in my case .zsh) so if it is not installed in .zsh it won't work at all.

19. Use a `.zshrc` to add commit push in one line:

```
function lazygit() {
    git add .
    git commit -a -m "$*"
    git push
}
```

20. Use `nvim -o \`fzf\` ` to edit a file found with fzf.
21. For Emmet shortcuts define ',' as the lead so tapping twice on ',' triggers emmet.
22. For commenting, use tcomment plug with `g+motion` or visual block mode with ctrl+v then add # to all lines (takes place only after typing ESC).

```
Explicit commenting/uncommenting:

    g<{motion}   :: Uncomment region
    g<c          :: Uncomment the current line
    g<b          :: Uncomment the current region as block

    g>{motion}   :: Comment region
    g>c          :: Comment the current line
    g>b          :: Comment the current region as block

In visual mode:

    gc           :: Toggle comments
    g>           :: Comment selected text
```

23. In Bash:

```

  main () {
    if [ "$1" != "" ]; then
        echo "One for $1, one for me."
    else
        echo "One for you, one for me."
    fi
  }
  # call main with all of the positional arguments
  main "$@"
```

- funcs don't need the argument passed to access it.
- args are accessed: $1 - $N.
- if ends with fi.

24. Pipe fzf results to any other bach command - rm for example:

```
fzf | xargs rm
```

25. In #REACT #JSX - to turn a boolean we can just assign it to the opposite:

```
chosenTask.isCompleted = !chosenTask.isCompleted;
```

## 12-10-21

26. Pass `fzf` args to `mv`:
    this will move whatever fzf finds to the example directory:

```
fzf |

while read fname
do
mv $fname Desktop/example/dir/things.md
done
```

## 18-10-21

27. Pass `fzf` args to `code` to open in VSCode:

```
code `fzf`
```

28. When coping a react project, we gotta do the `npm install` to get all the dependencies up and installed,
    and npm would know where to look for those if there exist a `package.json` file and the install is executed form
    the project's folder.

29. The difference between `class Portfolio extends Component {` and `class Portfolio extends Component() {` is quite big!
    If there is no need to invoke the function/ component , then don't do it. tabnine adds the paranthesis sometimes!

30. Spent at least one hour figuring out how to sign in to GitHub with VSCode - essentially, nothing worked besides deleting the PAT, creating a new one, creating a repo and trying to push --> then instead of password, use the PAT.

31. For some time the page wasn't interactive , JS wouldn't work / breaks since it was trying to get DOM elements before the DOM loads.

The solution for this is either to add the `defer` attribute to the script tag or to put the script tag at the bottom of the HTML so it renders after the DOM loads.
